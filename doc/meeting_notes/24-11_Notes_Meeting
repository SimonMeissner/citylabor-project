## Notes
1. Set agenda
2. Review topics from sprint meeting
	* data sources
		* @ Huriel: ask friend from landscape ecology if he has some sort of database.
		* Merel e-mailed professor from landscape ecology, no response yet. 
		* we keep on adding it manually for now. 
		* Jonas: hard to believe there is no plant database. Jonas knows people from landscape ecology. We can also directly reach out to urban garden people.
		* @ Jonas will contact some people from landscape ecology and Jonas Runthe's email address. 
	* developing API from our data?
		* we don't want to do this, at least for now. Should not be our priority. Keep it in mind as a backup plan. 
	* RShiny
		* responsive design: it's possible, but you don't have all the possibilities that JS would have (like Bootstrap). But that's not a problem.
		* seems to be feasible. 
3. User stories
	* need to be sent to Auriol
	* @ Merel will set up the user stories
4. Data acquisition
	* discussed in agenda point 2
5. DB structure
	* We need to transform when_to_plant column into seasons, but maybe later
	* We need a relationship between the when_to_plant and the climate. Should know how to interval the climate variable. 
	* @ Simon+Huriel: Simplify the Köpengeiger climate classification and add this as a column in the dataset. 
	* later: use a real database instead of the file. 
6. Model
	* Survival Analysis model: @ Jonas+Huriel do this code next Monday after class
	* ML model: overfitting.
	* Climate model
7. Model implementation
	* later 
8. First version of UI
	* later
	* user will open the html RShiny thing like in the mockup frontend
	* just some input fields and maybe a map
	* location retrieval: manually or just with GPS Location
	* @ Merel: how do devices look for GPS location?
9. Next sprint: presentation
	* @ Eesha: do SCRUM and presentation
	* @ Merel: post to do's in the Github project and in WhatsApp group
10. Review To-Do's
