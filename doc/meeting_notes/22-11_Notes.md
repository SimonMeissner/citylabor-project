## Sprint review #2 comments
* Include weather data as well, besides the climate data.
* Space that a plant needs is crucial (common error for urban gardeners), so good that we included this.
* What kind of data are you looking for? → Severin will send it to us.
* Structured database about plants that can be used for this? → wikipedia?
* Precipitation, month, climate: for many plants this is also important.
* Suggestion from Chris: we share the building with Landscape Ecology so we could ask a group from there.
* Many of the people who participate will likely be experienced gardeners. So you could implement an interface for experienced gardeners.
* Curated database we are creating could also be a result of the project as an API → this could be implemented in an RShiny app. We could provide documentation as well. (suggestion from Auriol)
* Check if RShiny works for mobile applications/responsive design.
* We need to send user stories to Auriol.

## To-Do’s
1. Email Severin about what type of data we need from the plants @ Merel
2. Ask Landscape Ecology if they have some sort of database that we’re looking for (Biodiversity and Ecosystem Research Group, prof. dr. Tillmann Buttschardt) @ Merel 
3. Check if RShiny works with responsive design/mobile apps @ Simon
4. Send user stories to Auriol
